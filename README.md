# Scene Extrapolation

_TLDR: Let's you easily create a circadian rythm like lighting experience! - Meaning lighting that adapts to the sun's cycle; cool at day, warm in the evening. The plugin creates a scene in your selected area which, when activated, lights your room just the way you want it - based on the sun's elevation. The scene is best matched with an automation that triggers the scene every 5 minutes or so (match the transition time for a silky smooth experience!)._

## Setup

Super simple to set up! Create two (or more) scenes. One with how you want the lighting to be at day, and one for the evening.

The integration automatically creates a transition between the scenes you configure - Lighting you room perfectly whenever you activate it!

## Advantages (compared to other solutions)

1. Simple to use and understand
2. Supports any colors - not just white and warm white!
3. Can turn off that too bright undimmable light in the evening
4. But can also turn ON that cozy low light lamp in the evening. (The one that doesn't need to be on during the day).
5. Since it's just a scene, it can control all sorts of things! (Not that I'd reccommend it?)
   - Sunshade down when the sun is out?
   - Door locked when the sun goes down?
6. Can use a dedicated scene at night (if an input_boolean is on)

## Disadvantages

1. Only works with scenes made in Home Assistant (Can't support eg. Hue scenes)
2. Requires you to setup at least two scenes for each area you want to control.
   - And as we all know, setting up and editing scenes in Home Assistant is TEDIOUS!
3. Performance is not the best. Takes 1 second to activate

   - Around 5 times longer than a basic scene, which usually takes around 200ms.

Alternative solutions:

1. [Flux (Built in Home Assistant addon)](https://next.home-assistant.io/integrations/flux)
   - Controls invividual lights directly. YAML configuration only. Seems abandoned, but probably works fine after setting up. At the time of writing being used by 559 active installations world wide.
2. [Circadian Rythm](https://github.com/claytonjn/hass-circadian_lighting)
   - Controls invividual lights or groups directly. Must turn off a boolean to deactivate the effect. Advanced features. Probably has the most active users with its 846(!) stars on GitHub.

## Expand functionality

_This integration is made to be simple on purpose. Leaving it simple makes it more predictable and transparent. No lights accidentally turning on after you've turned off the lights. No struggeling to activate or deactivate the effect. It's just a scene._

_A simple, predictable and transparent integration makes it easier to extend its functionality reliably with other parts of Home Assistant._

Examples of functionality you can add:

1. Slowly changing lights throughout the day?
   - Add an automation that repeatedly activates the scene eg. every 5 minutes, with a 5 minute transition. I have a blueprint available for this!
2. Motion activated lights matching the time of day?
   - Make an automation that simply activates the scene when motion is detected. I have a blueprint available for this!
